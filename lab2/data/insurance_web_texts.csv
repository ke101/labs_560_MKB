forum,reddit:r/Insurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1qm7bqt/is_my_landlord_committing_insurance_fraud_and/,Is my landlord committing insurance fraud? And trying to make me an accessory?,"(VERY) long story short. I just found out my landlord, who lives upstairs in a separate unit, illegally converted his single family home to a duplex 15 years ago, in violation of zoning and building code. I did NOT know this when I signed the lease, obviously. He has no license to rent (mandated in my state), no lead inspection (mandated in my state), and no lead safe certificate (mandated in my city). Again, all news to me. In December, he informed me via text that a HOI inspector would be coming and asked that I clean up very carefully, make it appear as if no one were living in the unit permanently, and not be present if possible. When I said I couldn’t guarantee that, he told me to make sure to say it was an “accessory” space if asked and to “lie if necessary” to avoid his rates going up by, in his words, 200%z I’m 99.99999% sure this is insurance fraud. He’s been doing this for the entire 15 years he’s had this unlicensed unit. Am I right to think this is insane?? I am not going to lie to an insurance adjuster for my slumlord landlord, but I want to know if I should report him anywhere?",211

Electronics. Trust/fraud.,For a separate product. I have proof of purchase for a used item. Also records showing I checked for fraud/blacklist and everything is clean. The reason I cannot finish the other claim is that it was “flagged”. I cannot reach anyone on why it was flagged. Flagged meaning it could be bad or good. So I have another claim. The insurance company can refuse to process this claim?,68
forum,reddit:r/Insurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/1qm5vxp/question_for_aaa_agents_ohio/,Question for AAA agents (Ohio),This might be easy and a dumb question but I’m entirely burned out by moving logistics I can’t think through. Moved from TX to OH. I tried to put in for a change of address but it told me to call. Called and they told me they couldn’t just update my existing policy. They’d have to give me a quote for a new policy. Ok makes sense- different taxes and whatever. So my bill from TX is due first week of Feb. My question is: is that prior billing cycle or to keep me current for Feb? I ask because I’m trying to determine if I should pay that policy if I won’t be using the coverage in TX anymore and only pay the new policy. Or yall end up merging the policies after the quote for the new state? It’s the weekend so can’t reach a rep and also just asking here so I don’t forget to call on Monday. Thank you!,163

I’ll be in temporary employee housing, and i’m not sure if that would qualify as an official permanent residence since I’ll only be at the job for about 4 months. I’d imagine that’s a long enough stay to require me to change my insurance, mostly wondering if the whole temporary employment/housing situation changes the circumstances at all. It would be nice to change it anyways as i expect it to be cheaper (Los Angeles vs Montana), so im also wondering if switching car insurance frequently is something that companies see as a negative or could affect rates. Since I’m not sure where i’ll go after this job but it will most likely not be the same place.",134

The back door on the driver side is now unable to open and there is damage on the front door and extensive damage around the rear wheel well also. It does still drive so she was able to get home. My 1 year old was in the vehicle as well so the car seat will be getting replaced as well which can be reimbursed under insurance as well from what I understand. We are located in NY and I was wondering how I should go about this. We have an incident report from police and the other party was ticketed for the accident.,133

I have taken precautions to make sure this never happens again but is there anything else I can do? No other insurance company will take me. Edit - My dog has never bit anyone else but he barks at strangers, I think the delivery driver bumped into him while he was barking and had an ‘injury’. I don’t think it matters at this point.",89

Once State Farm determines a car is a total loss, how long can I retain ownership of the car for, while still eventually accepting whatever offer is agreed upon? Also, does the timeline need to move quicker if I drop the car off at a select service shop?",89
